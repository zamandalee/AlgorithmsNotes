# JavaScript
- Strict mode
- Difference between a function expression and a function declaration
- Utility of IIFEs
- Prototypical inheritance
- Closures
- Async

### Overview
- Interpreted
- Prototype-based: style of OOP, classes not explicitly defined, instead objects are reused
- Multi-paradigm
  - Imperative/procedural programming (explicit statements that change program state), OOP, functional programming (functions to avoid global state)

### Asynchronous
- Asynchronous: engine runs in an event loop --> single program thread can handle concurrent operations
