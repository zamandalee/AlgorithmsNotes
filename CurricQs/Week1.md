## Algorithms
- How do we define a graph mathematically?
- What is the difference between directed, undirected, weighted, and unweighted?
- Give an example of various types of graphs (Weighted Undirected, Unweighted Directed, Unweighted Undirected, etc.)
- What makes a graph a simple graph? What attributes would make it not simple?
- What is the maximum number of edges in a directed simple graph? Undirected simple graph? Answer should be in terms of N
- Describe the levels of connectivity a graph can have (strongly connected, weakly connected).
- What are cycles?
- What are some naive ways we can store and traverse graphs? Be able to discuss time/space complexity of these approaches, and what issues we may face.
