## Algorithms
Intro
- How do we define a graph mathematically?
  - **G = (V, E)** for an ordered pair G of a set of vertices and a set of edges
- What is the difference between directed, undirected, weighted, and unweighted?
  - **Directed edge**: ordered pair w origin and destination (u, v) forming an undirected graph
  - **Undirected edge**: unordered pair {u, v} forming a digraph/directed graph
  - **Weighted edge**: can represent priority, length, cost, any difference in the connection
  - **Unweighted edge**: all of equal weight of 1 unit
- Give an example of various types of graphs (Weighted Undirected, Unweighted Directed, Unweighted Undirected, etc.)
  - Twitter (unweighted directed), FB (unweighted undirected), intercity roads (weighted, by rd length, undirected), intracity roads (weighted directed, by one-way/two-way rds)

Properties of Graphs

- What are cycles?
- What are some naive ways we can store and traverse graphs? Be able to discuss time/space complexity of these approaches, and what issues we may face.
- What are the three primary Fielding constraints? (Bonus if you can say who Fielding is!)
- What sub-constraints make up a Uniform Interface

## Web
- Walk through an arbitrary example of a RESTful request/response cycle, and describe what makes it RESTful

## JavaScript
- Give a high level overview of what an object's prototype represents
- What are the differences between the __proto__ and prototype attributes?
- What happens when we do or don't explicity set an object's prototype?
- What is an object's default prototype?
- What are the valid values for an object's prototype?

## HTML/CSS
- Name 5 benefits of HTML5
- What is localStorage? How might you use it?
- Why are media queries useful?
- What is mobile-first design? Be as specific as possible.
