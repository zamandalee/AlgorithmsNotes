# General Concepts

## Compiled vs. Interpreted
<img src="./Images/compiledinterpreted.png" width=400px/>

- In theory, languages can be either

- Interpreted language: interpreter parses and executes commands
  - +: portable, easier to debug
  - -: slow
    - Parsed, interpreted, and executed every time
  - Ex.: JS, Ruby, PHP, Python

- Compiled: converts to assembly language (depending on machine) --> binary code
  - +: fast
    - Overhead for the translation is incurred just once, when the source is compiled; thereafter, it need only be loaded and executed
  - -: only works on platform designed for
  - Ex.: C/C++, Go, Fortran
